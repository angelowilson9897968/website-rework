            Before building your portfolio, it's important to understand your comfort level with risk. In investing, "risk" is the chance that your investment could lose value, in exchange for the possibility of a higher return.

        <h2 style="color: #34495e; margin-bottom: 15px;">A Real-Life Example: Saving for a Vacation</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Imagine two friends, Alex and Ben, are saving for a big trip next year.</p>

        <div class="question" style="background-color: rgba(230, 247, 255, 0.9);">
            <h3>Alex is Cautious (Risk-Averse)</h3>
            <p>Alex puts all of his savings into a piggy bank. He knows his money is 100% safe and the amount will never go down. However, it also won't grow. When the year is over, he'll have exactly what he saved.
            <br><strong>This is a low-risk approach.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="question" style="background-color: rgba(255, 240, 230, 0.9);">
            <h3>Ben is Daring (Risk-Tolerant)</h3>
            <p>Ben uses his savings to buy rare comic books to sell for a profit. He could find a collector and double his money, affording a much better vacation. Or, the market could crash, and he could lose most of his savings.
            <br><strong>This is a high-risk approach.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 30px; text-align: center;">
            There is no "right" or "wrong" style. The goal is to find a balance that lets you sleep at night. The following quiz will help us understand if you're more like Alex, Ben, or somewhere in between.
